### Project Title
Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio

### Description
This project calculates the Sharpe Ratio, which is a measure of assessing the
return of an investment against a benchmark. The underlying data consists of
Amazon and Facebook stocks which are compared against the S&P 500 for the time
period from 04.01.2016 to 30.12.2016. After initial exploratory data analysis,
the inputs for the Sharpe formula are calculated via average excess returns
to arrive at an annualised measure.

### Files used
The project uses two csv-files available via DataCamp: 'stock_data.csv' and 'benchmark_data.csv'

### Credits
Stefan Jansen created the project tasks for DataCamp. The Python code in this
repository was accepted as my solution to the project.
